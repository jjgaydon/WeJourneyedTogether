      <p>Hello and welcome to We Journeyed Together, a one-shot tabletop role-playing game built to be played online from the ground up.</p>
      <p>Today, we will be discussing how to create a game using the companion web application.</p>
      <p>First, navigate to the website. Then, sign in with your google account.</p>
      <p>Next, click “Create New Game” in the My Hosted Games section of the menu.</p>
      <p>Give that game a unique name using alphanumeric characters.</p>
      <p>Select the number of players you will be playing with. Keep in mind that this player count includes yourself. It cannot be changed later.</p>
      <p>Select the module you will be using. The only module available at this time is Fantasy. Then, click next.</p>
      <p>Put in the google email accounts of all the players in your game. At this time, this cannot be changed later.</p>
      <p>Now, you will need to talk with your players about the story you are about to tell as a group. Decide what the Nemesis will be. Will it be a dark lord attempting to crush a rebellion? Will it be a doomsday event that the characters have to race to stop? </p>
      <p>Enter the name of your nemesis and a brief description.</p>
      <p>Click Create Game!</p>
      <p>This will take you back to the main menu. At this point, you and the players you invited may join the game. </p>
      <p>Players you invited will need to join the game by using the textbox in the My Other Games section to input the unique game name you assigned previously. Then, they will click Join Game.</p>
      <p>When either the host or a player tries to join your game, if they have not made a character yet, the system will prompt them to do that first. Creating characters will be covered in the next video. For now, all you need to know is that the character will need to be created before that particular player may log into the game and play.</p>
      <p>As the host of this game, you alone will have the authority to progress the story of the game and load encounters. Please ensure that whoever is the host of the game you are about to play is willing to be the one to take that responsibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection2" class="div-main" style="display:none">
      <br />
      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">Character Sheets</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VButb7B-ek" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Today, we will be investigating the character sheet and its attributes.</p>
      <p>When you first attempt to join a game you are hosting or were invited to, you will be prompted to create a character.</p>
      <p>First we have the name. This can be changed later if desired, and is the name that your character goes by.</p>
      <p>Next, we have childhood proficiency. This corresponds to one of the five biomes in the game, and will provide a bonus to any aspect checks made in a location that matches the biome listed in this proficiency. In the context of your story, this should reflect the kind of terrain your character grew up in and around. Did your character grow up in the woods? Up in the mountains? This cannot be changed later.</p>
      <p>Here we have Career proficiency. This corresponds to one of the five themes in the game, and will provide a bonus to any aspect checks made in a location that matches the theme listed in this proficiency. In the context of your story, this should reflect what your character studied by choice. Did your character learn to forage in starved environments? Did they study different forms of life with biodiversity. This cannot be changed later.</p>
      <p>Now, we have the aspect abilities. Each one of these corresponds to a number of an eight-sided die, or a d8. If you hover your mouse over the text, it will tell you the effect. For more information regarding the aspect abilities and how they work in the encounter system, please see part 3.1: choosing a location and resolving an encounter.</p>
      <p>For each aspect ability, choose one of the three aspects: Peace and Diplomacy or P&D for short, Aggression and Coordination or A&C for short, or Investigation and Analysis or I&A for short. When you roll your Action Hand, these will control which kinds of aspect checks you can make.</p>
      <p>This cannot be changed later. It is recommended that you have at least one of each aspect.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have the Deep Secret. The Deep Secret can be changed later, until a certain point when you will reveal it. The Deep Secret is something you keep to yourself, at least in the beginning, that ties your character to the nemesis. </p>
      <p>If the nemesis was a Dark Lord, perhaps they killed your character’s parents. Perhaps your character used to work for the nemesis, or caused it to come to power. Ultimately, it is up to you and should be based on the story you and your fellow players came up with when deciding what the nemesis was.</p>
      <p>These are the parts of your character that you choose during creation. There is more to your character that we will see once the game begins.</p>
      <p>Here is the character sheet in the game.</p>
      <p>There are a few new fields.</p>
      <p>Up here we have the experience points. This is how to keep track of the main form of progression in the game. Experience points will be used to do many things such as increase proficiency values or even heal wounds.</p>
      <p>Below we have the exhausted condition. When checked, it means that your character was the main character for a scene and won’t be cleared until the current tier of locations is completed. </p>
      <p>Next we have the childhood proficiency value. During creation you chose the *type*. Now, you have a value associated with it. When resolving an encounter with a biome of this kind, you gain a bonus to all aspect checks equal to the value. This may be increased at the end of each location tier.</p>
      <p>Below is the career proficiency, and the same rules apply except that it applies to the theme, not the biome. It will also cost more experience to increase, but unlike the child proficiency, you gain the career proficiency during the final confrontation.</p>
      <p>We now see that the aspect abilities table has an active column. This depicts if, in the current encounter, you have activated any aspect abilities. Please note that this is client-side and will not be saved if you relaunch the game.</p>
      <p>Next we have the aspect maturity. This starts at one for all aspects, and will increase as the game progresses. Mechanically, they do nothing until the final confrontation. In general, you will want to improve the aspect maturity of the aspect that appears most in your aspect ability mappings.</p>
      <p>Down here we have the Wounds table. Each aspect can have up to three wounds, which are acquired when failing an aspect check by rolling a “1” on the d8. They start at a value of 1 and will automatically increase at the end of every scene. If they would increase past a value of 5, the party gains a mistake point instead and it goes away. They can be removed at the end of a scene by spending experience points.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have the save changes button, which will update all information to the server-side.</p>
      <p>That is all for the character! It is certainly the most involved part of this game, but is one of the most important parts. In the next part, we will talk about resolving encounters.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection31" class="div-main" style="display:none">
      <br />
      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">Locations and Encounters</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQDZ-jY-xlA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Today, we will be learning the encounter system. To begin, the host of the game will need to open the journey map. Inside the tier that they select, there will be a menu to see previously-visited locations and select a new one.</p>
      <p>First, you must choose who will be the main player for the next location and encounter. You must choose someone who has not been the main player yet during this tier. In other words, you must choose a player who does not have the exhausted condition. Use the main player drop down to select which player will be the main player, and then click the button for that player’s preferred location. </p>
      <p>Make note of the biome and the theme, because the main player may or may not get bonuses to their aspect checks if they have a match or not.</p>
      <p>Once the main player is selected, a different player should be chosen as the narrator. The narrator will be like a temporary game master in that they will describe the consequences and benefits to the main player’s choice of action.</p>
      <p>Once you select it, a random encounter will replace the journey map on the screen. There are a few things to note about each encounter.</p>
      <p>Here you see the name of the encounter and its flavor-description. The description doesn’t have to be followed to the letter, it is there more for inspiration and guidance.</p>
      <p>Under the description we have the number of successes necessary to succeed. If the main player makes an aspect check that is a success, click the plus button. Once they have acquired all of the successes necessary, you may click the success button at the bottom. If the player runs out of aspect check uses before hitting the minimum number of successes, then click the failure button.</p>
      <p>Below the success count we see the challenge levels table. This dictates what number on the d8, plus or minus modifiers, that you need to get to acquire a success with a particular aspect check. This means that some aspects may be more useful in some encounters than others.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have the optional reward combinations. If you succeeded using the listed number of each type of aspect, you may give yourself an additional experience at the end of the encounter, indicated by the Reward Value.</p>
      <p>These are the data fields of the encounter that you will see. However, to resolve an encounter the player must first roll an action hand. They can do this by rolling 5d8 with physical dice and then using the roll 1d8 text box and Roll Manually button to input the numbers that they rolled, or they can use the Roll Action Hand button to automatically have the computer roll.</p>
      <p>Once you have generated your action hand, inspect the active aspect abilities to see which ones are active. Make sure to inspect each one to make sure no further actions are required. For example, Renewed and Inspired Aspect both generate more aspect uses before the encounter starts, so be sure to check.</p>
      <p>At this point, the narrator will use the prompt for the encounter to describe a scene and present the challenge that the main player needs to overcome. The player will then formulate a plan based on their aspect uses, which are these yellow buttons, and describe what they try to do. </p>
      <p>Once they are done describing, they will click the button to roll it. Then, they will add relevant modifiers such as empowered aspect, wounds, or proficiencies, and compare that to the challenge level of the encounter’s corresponding aspect. </p>
      <p>Each empowered aspect active provides a plus 1, each weakened aspect provides a minus 1, each proficiency active provides a bonus equal to its value, and if wounds will provide their own penalty of -1 if you have one wound in the aspect you are making an aspect check for, or -2 if you have two or three wounds in that aspect.</p>
      <p>For example, if I wanted to make an aggression and coordination aspect check, I could say that I will try to climb a tree for some high ground. I would then try to roll it, and if I beat the challenge level then I succeeded. If I don’t, then I failed. </p>
      <p>There is no penalty to failed checks outside of narrative description, besides that you have lost a chance to gain a success for the encounter.</p>
      <p>Once you are finished with the encounter, click the clear hand button.</p>
      <p>Congratulations! You have completed your first encounter!</p>
      <p>In the next video, we will talk about post-encounter scenes.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection32" class="div-main" style="display:none">
      <br />
      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">Scenes</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeveSjKW788" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>In this video, we will learn how to resolve a post-encounter scene. Once you either succeed or fail in an encounter, you will be presented with this menu. The main player will roll another action hand and count how many of each aspect they rolled. It’s important to note that any Aspect Ability that adds more Aspect uses to your hand will impact this, so make sure you check that before calling it done.</p>
      <p>At this point, you may look at the options presented at this menu. You will need at least 2 of the same aspect to Relax or Reflect, which will award you one experience point. This is by far the worst option, but sometimes you may not have another choice, or you may want that extra experience for an extra bump to your stats.</p>
      <p>For all other results, the Aspect that you use will affect what you can do. For example, if you train another, you may only train another character in the aspect maturity corresponding to the 3 aspect uses you have. If I rolled 3 A&C and 2 P&D, then I could only train another in A&C maturity.</p>
      <p>If I heal another character, I may only heal an A&C wound, by the same logic. The same goes for training yourself or healing yourself, except obviously you would be affecting yourself and not another character, not to mention that it costs one extra so it is harder to acquire.</p>
      <p>It is important to note during character creation that specialists, or characters who have mapped most of their aspect abilities to the same aspect, are usually very good at resolving scenes, because they typically will roll the same aspect and thus have 3 or 4 of the same aspect in most cases. However, you will only ever be able to heal or train in that aspect most of the time, so keep that in mind.</p>
      <p>After resolving one of these options, you can roleplay with another character to attempt to explain narratively how this occurs. For example, if a character suffers an A&C check and fractures a bone, maybe another character helps bandage them for the healing option. </p>
      <p>At the end of the Scene, any player may spend four experience points to resolve their own wound. Then, all wounds are increased. At this point, the main player is given the exhausted status, 6 experience points, and we return back to the encounter location selection.</p>
      <p>In the next section, we will briefly discuss wounds.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection33" class="div-main" style="display:none">
      <br />
      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">Wounds</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEwSr8Coilg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>In this video, we will discuss how wounds function.</p>
      <p>When your character rolls a natural 1 (natural 1 means the d8 rolls a 1 before modifiers) and fails an aspect check, they gain a wound in the aspect of the check they were rolling, as long as they have fewer than 3 wounds.</p>
      <p>The value of the wound starts at 1, and you have the options of setting a description. For example, an I&A wound could be a concussion that makes it hard to think.</p>
      <p>When rolling an aspect check, you gain a penalty according to how many wounds you have. If you have zero wounds in the aspect you are making a check for, the penalty is zero. If you have one wound, you have a minus 1 penalty. If you have two or three wounds, you have a minus two penalty.</p>
      <p>When a wound is resolved, the player with the wound gains experience points equal to the value of the wound and the wound disappears. In other words, it returns to a value of 0.</p>
      <p>Wounds are resolved when a player uses their post-encounter scene to heal another or spends 4 experience points to clear a wound at the end of a scene. They are also resolved when, at the end of a scene, the wound is increased and it would increase past four. If it has a value of four and would go to five, it is instead resolved at value 4 and the players gain a mistake point.</p>
      <p>It is important not to let your wounds add up!</p>
      <p>In the next section, we will talk about end of tier and deep secrets.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection34" class="div-main" style="display:none">
      <br />
      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">End-of-Tier and Deep Secrets</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rotW6X3RMik" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>In this video, we will discuss the end of tier and deep secrets.</p>
      <p>When each player has been the main character of an encounter and scene, the end of the tier is reached. In other words, after a number of encounters equal to the number of players, the end of tier is reached.</p>
      <p>When this happens, the new tier will become available in the journey map. Before we proceed, however, there are a few things we must do.</p>
      <p>The first is that anyone may spend experience points to increase their stats. An aspect maturity may be increased by spending 2 experience points, your childhood proficiency may be increased by spending 2 experience points, and your career proficiency may be increased by spending 6 experience points.</p>
      <p>Next, everyone clears their exhausted status condition and saves changes.</p>
      <p>After everyone has finished deciding what, if any, attributes will be increased as well as clearing exhaustion, a player will likely reveal their deep secret.</p>
      <p>It is up to the players who reveals their deep secret, but in general, it should follow the following form.</p>
      <p>For two players, there should be no reveals at the end of tier 1, but one player reveals a deep secret at the end of tier 2 and 3.</p>
      <p>For three players, one player should reveal a deep secret at the end of each tier.</p>
      <p>For four players, one player reveals a deep secret at the end of tier one and three, but two players reveal their deep secrets at the end of tier two.</p>
      <p>Finally, when playing with five players, one player reveals a deep secret at the end of tier 1, and two players reveal their deep secrets at the end of tiers 2 and 3.</p>
      <p>The deep secret is something determined usually at the beginning of the game, and should tie your character to the nemesis. For example, if the nemesis is a zombie plague, perhaps your character accidentally helped to create it in the top secret science lab, meaning that you are guilty yet you know best how to stop it…</p>
      <p>Once the end of tier decisions and deep secrets are revealed, you may proceed to the next tier. If the tier you just finished was tier 3, then you are ready to proceed to the final confrontation.</p>
      <p>In the next section, we will learn how to play in the final confrontation.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divSection35" class="div-main" style="display:none">

      <label style="font-weight: bolder;">The Final Confrontation</label>
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/loGRq1EelWc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>In this video, we will discuss the final confrontation.</p>
      <p>The final confrontation is the last stage of the game, and is broken up into two parts: the threat revealed and the desperate gambit. In both of these parts, players may gain their bonuses from their career proficiencies.</p>
      <p>Before beginning, choose one player to be the narrator for the threat revealed and a different player to be the narrator for the desperate gambit. That narrator describes how the nemesis deals a significant blow to their character, removing them from the fight.</p>
      <p>To play the threat revealed, have all players except for the narrator of the threat revealed roll an action hand. The player who will be narrating the desperate gambit gains an additional 1d8 to their action hand.</p>
      <p>Then, encounter-style, each player will take turns doing aspect checks until they run out of aspect uses in their action hands. The challenge level for each aspect is 6. </p>
      <p>Each time they succeed on an aspect check, the player that made the aspect check deals damage to the nemesis equal to their aspect maturity in that aspect.</p>
      <p>If the nemesis should run out of health before the threat revealed is complete or the players run out of aspect uses, then instantly proceed to the desperate gambit.</p>
      <p>Once the players are ready for the desperate gambit, the narrator of the desperate gambit should describe how their character does something risky that severely harms the nemesis or advances the goal of the characters, but is severely injured in the process so that they will be unable to fight in the next stage of the game. Meanwhile, the narrator will also describe how the previously-incapacitated character wakes up and is ready to join the fight. In other words, the new narrator’s character is incapacitated and the previous narrator’s character is now available to participate.</p>
      <p>If the nemesis had zero health by the beginning of the desperate gambit, then the new narrator’s character deal the final blow. Otherwise, all players except the narrator of the desperate gambit roll action hands. The narrator of the threat revealed rolls one additional d8 to their action hand.</p>
      <p>Play continues just as it had in the previous part, except that the challenge level of all aspect checks becomes 5 for each aspect.</p>
      <p>Finally, if the players are able to take the nemesis’ health to zero before they run out of aspect checks, then they win and defeat the nemesis. If they fail to do so, then the game ends in tragedy as the characters lose and the nemesis is triumphant.</p>
